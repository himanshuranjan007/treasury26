//! Test for monitoring accounts with only a creation balance change
//!
//! `test-treasury.sputnik-dao.near` was created at block ~184993794 with ~6 NEAR.
//! This is its only balance change ever. The monitoring system should detect it.
//!
//! The issue: when `seed_initial_balance` binary searches backwards, it reaches blocks
//! where the account doesn't exist yet. The NEAR RPC returns an error (not 0), which
//! propagates and kills the entire seeding process. The fix is to treat "account does
//! not exist" errors as balance 0 in the NEAR balance query.
